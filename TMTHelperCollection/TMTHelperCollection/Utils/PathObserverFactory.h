 The path observer is an object which uses an FSEventStream for monitoring changes to a given directory.
 
 Instances of this class are currently able to notifiy observers for changes in the given directory of the following type:
 
    - item renaming
    - item creating
    - item removing
 
 @warning *Important:* Instances of this class should never be generated directly. Use the [PathObserverFactory pathObserverForPath:] method instead.
