================

This is a very simple Mac OS X application that allows you to test regular expressions against sample text. It is based on the Mac OS SDK's implementation of [NSRegularExpression](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Foundation/Reference/NSRegularExpression_Class/Reference/Reference.html), which is based on [ICU](http://site.icu-project.org). 

My problem is that, as a Rails developer, I'd grown accustomed to using [Rubular](http://www.rubular.com), a brilliant regex testing tool. However, there are subtle differences in the syntax of regular expressions between the Mac SDK and others. This tool ensures that the expressions I enter will actually work when implemented in code.
