        <string>Simply typing three “.” in a row will not give a perfect spacing withing the between the dots. The \ldots is much more suitable for this.
            In math mode, you should also distinguish between \cdots and \ldots</string>
        
        <key>18</key>
        <string>Self-explanatory. Look in the example, and you’ll understand why.
            This is an "example"
            This is an "example"
            This is an ‘‘example’’
            This is an “example”</string>
        <key>19</key>
        <string>On some keyboards you might get the wrong quote. This quote looks, IMHO, ugly compared to the standard quotes, it doesn’t even come out as a quote!</string>
        <key>25</key>
        <string>This warning is given whenever ChkTEX finds a “ˆ”’ or a “_” followed by either two or more numberic digits or two or more alphabetic characters. In most situations, this means that you’ve forgotten some {}’s.</string>
        <key>35</key>
        <string>Most mathematical operators should be set as standard roman font, instead of the math italic LATEX uses for variables. For many opera- tors, LATEX provides a pre-defined command which will typeset the operator correctly. Look below for an illustration of the point.
            VerbEnvir</string>
        <key>43</key>
        <string>LATEX’ error message when calling \left \{ instead of left \{ is unfortunately rather poor. This warning detects this and similar errors.</string>
