    <key>1</key>
    <string>You tried to terminate a command with a blank space. Usually, this is an error as these are ignored by
        LATEX. In most cases, you would like to have a real space there.
    </string>
    <key>2</key>
    <string>When reading a document, it is not very pretty when references are split across lines. If you use the ~
        character, LATEX will assign a very high penalty for splitting a line at that point. ChkTEX issues this warning
        if you have forgot to do this.
    </string>
    <key>3</key>
    <string>This is a warning which you may ignore, but for maximum aestethic pleasure, you should enclose your bracket
        characters with ‘{}’s.
    </string>
    <key>9</key>
    <string>‘%s’ expected, found ‘%s’.</string>
    <key>14</key>
    <string>ChkTEX will in some cases need the argument of a function to detect an error. As ChkTEX currently processes
        the LATEX file on a line-by- line basis, it won’t find the argument if the command which needed it was on the
        previous line. On the other hand, this may also be an error; you ought to check it to be safe.
    </string>
    <key>15</key>
    <string>This warning is triggered if we find a single, opening bracket or environment. While bracket matching is not
        an explicit error, it is usually a sign that something is wrong.
    </string>
    <key>16</key>
    <string>This error is triggered if you at some point have turned on math- mode, and ChkTEX couldn’t see that you
        remembered to turn it off.
    </string>
    <key>17</key>
    <string>Should be self-explanatory. ChkTEX didn’t find the same number of an opening bracket as it found of a
        closing bracket.
    </string>
    <key>20</key>
    <string>A substring you’ve specified using USERWARN in the “chktexrc” file, has been found.</string>
    <key>21</key>
    <string>I implemented this because a friend of mine kept on making these mistakes. Easily done if you haven’t gotten
        quite into the syntax of LATEX.
    </string>
    <key>22</key>
    <string>ChkTEX dumps all comments it finds, which in some cases is useful. I usually keep all my notes in the
        comments, and like to review them before I ship the final version. For commenting out parts of the document, the
        “comment” environment is better suited.
    </string>
    <key>27</key>
    <string>Some LATEX commands will be interpreted by ChkTEX; however, some of them are sensible to errors in the LATEX
        source. Most no- tably, the \input command relies on that the input file exists...
    </string>
    <key>28</key>
    <string>Italic correction should generally not be used in front of small punc- tuation characters like ‘.’ and ‘,’;
        as it looks better when the pre- ceding italic character leans “over” the punctum or comma.
    </string>
    <key>31</key>
    <string>Certain implementations of the verbatim environment and deriva- tions of that, ignore all text on the same
        line as \end{verbatim}. This will warn you about this.
    </string>
    <key>32</key>
    <string></string>
    <key>33</key>
    <string></string>
    <key>34</key>
    <string>Proper quotations should start with a ‘ and end with a ’; anything else isn’t very pretty. Both these
        warnings are relative to this; look in the example below.
    </string>
    <key>38</key>
    <string>For best looking documents, you should decide on how you wish to put quotes relative to punctuation. ChkTEX
        recognizes two styles; you may specify which you use in the “chktexrc” file.
    </string>
    <key>39</key>
    <string>This warning is triggered whenever ChkTEX finds a space in front of a hard space, or vice versa. This will
        be rendered as two spaces (which you usually don’t wish).
    </string>
    <key>42</key>
    <string>Some commands should not be prepended by a space character, for cosmetical reasons. This notes you of this
        whenever this has hap- pened.
    </string>
