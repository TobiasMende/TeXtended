        <string>If you try to use the \/ command when ChkTEX believes that the buffer is not outputted as italic, you’ll get this warning.</string>
        <key>5</key>
        <string>If the buffer is italic, and you try to use the \/ command more than once, you’ll get this warning.</string>
        <key>6</key>
        <string>You get this error if ChkTEX believes that you are switching from italic to non-italic, and you’ve forgot to use the \/ command to insert that extra little spacing. If you use the “em” option, you may ignore this warning.</string>
        <key>7</key>
        <string>If you’re using accenting commands, ‘i’ and ‘j’ should lose their dots before they get accented. This is accomplished by using the \i, \j, \imath and \jmath command.</string>
        <key>8</key>
        <string>This warning suggests that a wrong number of dashes may have been used. It does this by classifying the dash according to the the character in front and after the dashes.
            If they are of the same type, ChkTEX will determine which keyword to use in the “chktexrc” file. If not, it will shut up and accept that it doesn’t know.</string>
        <key>10</key>
        <string>Either brackets or environments don’t match. ChkTEX expects to find matching brackets/environments in the same order as their op- posites were found, and no closing delimiters which haven’t been preceded by an opening one.
            While bracket matching is not an explicit error, it is usually a sign that something is wrong.</string>
        <key>12</key>
        <string>One of the specified abbreviations were found. Unless you have pre- viously said \frenchspacing, you’ll have incorrect spacing, which one should avoid if possible.</string>
        <key>13</key>
        <string>LATEX’ detection of whether a period ends a sentence or not, is only based upon the character in front of the period. If it’s uppercase, it assumes that it does not end a sentence. While this may be correct in many cases, it may be incorrect in others. ChkTEX thus outputs this warning in every such case.</string>
        <key>23</key>
        <string>This error is generated whenever you try to typeset three quotes in a row; this will not look pretty, and one of them should be separated from the rest.</string>
        <key>24</key>
        <string>This message, issued when a space is found in front of a \index, \label or similar command (can be set in the “chktexrc” file). Sometimes, this space may cause that the word and the index hap- pens on separate pages, if a pagebreak happens just there.
            You might also use this warning to warn you about spaces in front of footnotes; however, the warning text may not be entirely correct then.</string>
        <key>26</key>
        <string>This warning is issued if ChkTEX finds space in front of an end-of- sentence character.</string>
        <key>29</key>
        <string>In ASCII environments, it is usual to use the ‘x’ character as an infix operator to denote a dimension. The mathemathical symbol × provided by the $\times$ command is better suited for this.</string>
        <key>30</key>
        <string>This warning, intended for the novice, will remind you that even if you type multiple spaces in your input, only a single space will come out. Some ways to come around this is listed below.</string>
        <key>36</key>
        <string>Outside math mode, you should put a space in front of any group of opening parenthesis, and no spaces after. If you have several after each other, you should of course not put a space in between each. Likewise, there should not be spaces in front of closing parenthesis, but there should be at least one after.</string>
        <key>37</key>
        <string>Outside math mode, you should put a space in front of any group of opening parenthesis, and no spaces after. If you have several after each other, you should of course not put a space in between each. Likewise, there should not be spaces in front of closing parenthesis, but there should be at least one after.</string>
        <key>40</key>
        <string>As recommended in the TEXbook, you should try to put punctuation outside inner math mode, as this is gets formatted better.
            Similarily, you should let any final punctuation in display math mode end up within it.</string>
        <key>41</key>
        <string>This warning is triggered whenever you use a raw TEX command which has been replaced by a LATEX equivalent. If you consider yourself a purist (or want to be sure your code works under LATEX3), you should use the LATEX equivalent.</string>
