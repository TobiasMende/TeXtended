/**
 * This class displays line numbers and markers at the side of
 * a NSScrollView.
 * It is a extention of the NSRulerView and thus can be added as
 * such to a NSScrollView. It will then automaticly update its model
 * when the text in the NSSCrollViews documentView changes and will
 * automaticly scroll with the NSScrollViews content.
 *
 * Implementation of this class is inspired and based on
 * the NoodleLineNumberView from Paul Kim provided by Noodlesoft,
 * which stands under MIT-license.
 * See there [blog entry](http://www.noodlesoft.com/blog/2008/10/05/displaying-line-numbers-with-nstextview/)
 * for more information.
